Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domail }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case your forgot your Django Boards username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the url in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it is likely that another user entered your email address by mistake
while trying to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further
action and can safely disregard this email.

Thank you,

The Django Boards Team
